# twitter-automation

## Introduction

A simple Python script that grew a motivational quotes Twitter account to several thousands of followers on auto-pilot.

## Motivation

Based on the principle of reciprocity, automating engagement with other users' Tweets made them more likely to follow the account and like Tweets back.

Select users were targeted based on whether they had previously followed similar profiles.

## Features

- Automates engagement with specific user accounts
- Retrieves motivational quotes via the free Zenquotes API
- Generates centered text with custom font over a black background as an image (shown below)
